    "## 1. Introduction to Carbon Nanomaterials\n",
    "Nanomaterials are materials that have structural features at the nanometer scale, typically below 100 nm. Carbon nanomaterials exhibit unique mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them essential in modern technology.\n",

    "## 2. Graphite\n",
    "### Physical Properties:\n",
    "- **Soft and Slippery:** Layers of carbon atoms are held together by weak van der Waals forces, allowing them to slide over each other.\n",
    "- **Grey-Black, Opaque Appearance:** It has a metallic sheen but is not reflective like metals.\n",
    "- **Lightweight:** Density of ~2.26 g/cm³.\n",
    "- **Good Electrical Conductor:** Each carbon atom is bonded to three others, leaving a free electron that moves through the layers.\n",
    "- **High Melting Point (~3,600°C):** Strong covalent bonds within layers require significant energy to break.\n",
    "- **Insoluble in Water and Organic Solvents:** Strong covalent bonds prevent dissolution.\n",
