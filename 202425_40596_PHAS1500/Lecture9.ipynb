    "## **1. Hybridization and sp Orbitals**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hybridization** occurs when atomic orbitals mix to form new, equivalent hybrid orbitals.  \n",
    "- **sp Hybridization:**  \n",
    "  - The **2s orbital** mixes with just **one** of the **2p orbitals** to form **two equivalent sp orbitals**.\n",
    "  - The two sp orbitals are **arranged linearly**, with the remaining **2p orbitals perpendicular** to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",

    "### **1.1 sp¹ Hybridized Carbon & Bonding in Ethyne (C₂H₂)**\n",
    "- In ethyne (acetylene), **each carbon is sp hybridized**, leading to:\n",
    "  1. Two **C-H σ bonds**:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $$C(sp^1) - H(1s)$$\n",
    "  2. One **σ bond** between the two carbons:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $$C(sp^1) - C(sp^1)$$\n",
    "  3. Two **π bonds** (overlapping p orbitals), creating a **triple bond (C≡C)**:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     $$C \\equiv C$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## **2. Conjugation and Delocalisation**  \n",
    "- **Conjugation** occurs when **double and single bonds alternate**, allowing **p orbitals to overlap**, forming a **delocalized π electron cloud**.\n",
    "- **Effects of Conjugation:**\n",
    "  - Leads to **characteristic spectral absorptions** (UV-visible).\n",
    "  - As conjugation increases, the energy difference between bonding and anti-bonding π orbitals **decreases**, causing **absorption in the visible range**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Delocalisation and Aromaticity**\n",
    "- **Aromaticity** occurs when cyclic compounds have **delocalized π molecular orbitals** extending over all atoms.\n",
    "- **Example: Benzene (C₆H₆)**  \n",
    "  - The **bonding levels are fully occupied**, making it **extremely stable**.\n",
    "  - The electrons are **evenly distributed**, forming a **resonance structure**:\n",

    "  - Oxygen:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$1s^2 2s^2 2p^4$$\n",
    "- **Lone pairs:**  \n",
    "  - Nitrogen and oxygen have **unbonded electron pairs** (lone pairs), which affect molecular shape.\n",
    "  - **Lone pairs repel more strongly than bonded electrons**, causing deviations from perfect tetrahedral angles.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    - **Methane (CH₄):** Perfect tetrahedral.\n",
    "    - **Ammonia (NH₃):** Slightly compressed due to lone pair repulsion.\n",
    "    - **Water (H₂O):** More compressed, with a **bond angle of 104.4°**.\n",

    "### **4.1 Hydrogen Bonds in Water**\n",
    "- **Hydrogen bonds** occur due to **strong dipole-dipole interactions**.\n",
    "- Water’s hydrogen bonds result in:\n",
    "  - **High boiling point**.\n",
    "  - **Ice having a lower density than water** due to an open hexagonal structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.2 Van der Waals Interactions**\n",
    "- **Van der Waals forces** arise from **fluctuating dipoles** that create weak **attractive interactions**.\n",
    "- **Factors influencing strength:**\n",
    "  - **Size of electron cloud** (larger atoms/molecules have stronger Van der Waals forces).\n",
    "  - **Proximity of molecules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4.3 Lennard-Jones Potential (LJ Potential)**\n",
    "- Describes **Van der Waals interactions** mathematically:\n",
    "  - **Attractive term** (dominant at longer distances).\n",
    "  - **Repulsive term** (dominant at short distances, due to the Pauli exclusion principle).\n",
    "  - The **Lennard-Jones potential** equation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$U(r) = 4\\epsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^6 \\right]$$\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "    - $\\epsilon $ = depth of the potential well (interaction strength).\n",
    "    - $ \\sigma $ = atomic radius.\n",
