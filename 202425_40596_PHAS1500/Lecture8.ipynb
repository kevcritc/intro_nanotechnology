    "# **Molecular Orbitals and Covalent Bonding**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to Molecular Orbitals**\n",
    "- Covalent bonding can be understood using **molecular orbital theory**.\n",
    "- Instead of treating electrons as belonging to individual atoms, we consider **molecular orbitals** formed by atomic orbitals.\n",
    "- The number of **molecular orbitals** formed is equal to the number of **atomic orbitals** combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. The Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)**\n",
    "- Molecular orbitals are formed by adding or subtracting atomic orbitals:\n",
    "  - Bonding orbital (σ, π): Constructive interference (lower energy, stabilizing).\n",
    "  - Anti-bonding orbital (σ*, π*): Destructive interference (higher energy, destabilizing).\n",
    "- Electrons fill molecular orbitals according to **Aufbau’s principle** and **Hund’s rule**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Origin of Bonding and Anti-Bonding Orbitals**\n",
    "- When two atomic orbitals overlap, they combine in two possible ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Constructive Interference (Bonding Orbital)**:\n",
    "     - The wavefunctions of atomic orbitals add together, increasing electron density between the nuclei.\n",
    "     - This lowers the energy of the system, stabilizing the bond.\n",
    "     - Example: The \\( 1s \\) orbitals of two hydrogen atoms combine to form a **bonding σ molecular orbital**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **Destructive Interference (Anti-Bonding Orbital)**:\n",
    "     - The wavefunctions subtract from each other, leading to a **node** (region of zero electron density) between the nuclei.\n",
    "     - This raises the energy of the system, making the molecule less stable.\n",
    "     - Example: The same \\( 1s \\) orbitals of hydrogen also form an **anti-bonding σ* molecular orbital**, which is higher in energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anti-bonds are more destabilizing than bonds are stabilizing**, which is why molecules prefer filling bonding orbitals first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Molecular Orbitals in  $H_2$ and $He_2$**\n",
    "- $H_2$ forms because only the **bonding 1s $\\sigma$ orbital** is occupied.\n",
    "- $He_2$ does not form because both bonding 1s $\\sigma$ and anti-bonding 1s $\\sigma^*$ orbitals are occupied, canceling stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Sigma (σ) and Pi (π) Bonds**\n",
    "- **Sigma (σ) Bonds:** Formed by end-to-end overlap of **s** or **p** orbitals along the bond axis.\n",
    "- **Pi (π) Bonds:** Formed by **sideways** overlap of p orbitals above and below the atomic axis.\n",
    "- **Single bonds** are sigma bonds, **double bonds** have one sigma and one pi bond, and **triple bonds** have one sigma and two pi bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Hybrid Molecular Orbitals**\n",
    "- **Hybridization** explains molecular shapes and equivalent bonding in molecules.\n",
    "- **$sp^3$ hybridization:** One **s** orbital + three **p** orbitals → four equivalent **$ sp^3 $** orbitals (e.g., methane $CH_4$.\n",
    "- **$sp^2$ hybridization:** One **s** orbital + two **p** orbitals → three **$sp^2$** orbitals (e.g., ethene $ C_2H_4 $).\n",
    "- ** sp  hybridization:** One **s** orbital + one **p** orbital → two ** sp ** orbitals (e.g., acetylene $ C_2H_2 $).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Hybridization in Methane and Ethene**\n",
    "- **Methane (CH₄):** Carbon undergoes **$sp^3$ hybridization**, forming four equivalent bonds at **109.5°**.\n",
    "- **Ethene (C₂H₄):** Carbon undergoes **$ sp^2$ hybridization**, forming a **planar structure** with a **double bond**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Key Differences Between σ and π Bonds**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature      | Sigma (σ) Bond | Pi (π) Bond |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Orbital Overlap | End-to-end | Sideways |\n",
    "| Strength | Stronger | Weaker |\n",
    "| Rotation | Free Rotation | Restricted Rotation |\n",
    "| Bond Type | Present in single, double, triple bonds | Present in double and triple bonds only |\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Example Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem 1: Molecular Orbitals in $ O_2$**\n",
    "1. Draw the molecular orbital diagram for $O_2 $.\n",
    "2. Determine its bond order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Bond order} = \\frac{\\text{(Bonding electrons - Antibonding electrons)}}{2} = \\frac{(8 - 4)}{2} = 2$$\n",
    "- Since there are **unpaired electrons in the π* orbital**, $O_2$ is **paramagnetic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Problem 2: Hybridization in Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**\n",
    "1. What type of hybridization does carbon have in $ CO_2 $?\n",
    "2. Predict the bond angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Carbon undergoes **sp hybridization**, forming two sigma bonds and two pi bonds.\n",
    "- The bond angles are **180°** (linear geometry).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Main Takeaways**\n",
    "- **Molecular orbitals** result from atomic orbital combinations (bonding and anti-bonding).\n",
    "- **Bonding orbitals** lower the energy of a molecule, while **anti-bonding orbitals** increase it.\n",
    "- **Sigma bonds** involve direct orbital overlap, while **pi bonds** form via sideways p orbital interactions.\n",
    "- **Hybridization** explains molecular shapes and bonding equivalence.\n",
    "- **Bond order** determines bond strength and stability, while **unpaired electrons** indicate paramagnetism.\n",
    "- **π bonds** are more reactive than σ bonds due to their electron distribution.\n",
