    "## **1. Introduction to the Bohr Model**\n",
    "- The Bohr model was developed as an improvement over classical physics to explain atomic structure, particularly the hydrogen atom.\n",
    "- It successfully explained the discrete spectral lines of hydrogen.\n",
    "- Bohr was awarded the **Nobel Prize in 1922** for this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. The Bohr Postulates**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 First Postulate: Stationary States**  \n",
    "- Electrons in an atom can only occupy certain **stable, non-radiating circular orbits** known as **stationary states**.\n",
    "- These orbits are **quantized**, meaning electrons cannot exist in between these orbits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Second Postulate: Energy and Radiation**  \n",
    "- The frequency of radiation emitted or absorbed by an electron is related to the energy difference between two stationary states:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E_f - E_i = h\\nu \\tag{1}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - $E_f$ and $E_i$ are the final and initial energy levels.\n",
    "  - $h$ is Planck’s constant.\n",
    "  - $\\nu$ is the frequency of the emitted radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Third Postulate: Quantized Angular Momentum**  \n",
    "- The allowed electron orbits are determined by the condition that the electron's **angular momentum** is quantized:\n",
    " \\begin{equation}\n",
    "m v r = n \\hbar \\tag{2}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - $m$ is the electron’s mass.\n",
    "  - $v$ is the velocity of the electron.\n",
    "  - $r$ is the radius of the orbit.\n",
    "  - $n$ is a positive integer $ n = 1, 2, 3, ... $\n",
    "  - $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi}$ is the reduced Planck’s constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This explains why only certain orbits are allowed and why electrons do not spiral into the nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. The Bohr Radius**\n",
    "- The radius of the lowest energy orbit (\\( n=1 \\)) is known as the **Bohr radius**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a_0 = \\frac{4\\pi\\epsilon_0\\hbar^2}{m e^2} \\tag{3}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- For hydrogen  Z=1 , the Bohr radius is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "a_0 = 0.0529 \\text{nm} \\tag{4}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- This result was derived using classical mechanics and electrostatic force principles.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **4. Energy Levels in the Bohr Model**\n",
    "- The quantized energy levels for hydrogen are given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " E_n = -\\frac{E_0Z^2}{n^2} \\tag{5}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Key values:\n",
    "  - **$E_0 = 13.6 \\text{eV}$**\n",
    "  - **Ground state n=1:  $E_1 = -E_0 $ eV**\n",
    "  - **Excited states: $E_2 = -3.4$ eV etc.**\n",
    "  - **Ionization limit n = ∞: $E = 0$ eV**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The energy difference between levels determines the wavelength of emitted light:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\lambda = \\frac{1240 \\text{ eV⋅nm}}{E} \\tag{6}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "- This successfully explained the **Rydberg formula** for hydrogen’s spectral lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. The Bohr Model and Spectral Series**\n",
    "- The Bohr model explains the emission spectra of hydrogen:\n",
    "  - **Lyman series:** Transitions to $ n=1 $ (UV region)\n",
    "  - **Balmer series:** Transitions to $ n=2 $ (Visible region)\n",
    "  - **Paschen series:** Transitions to $ n=3 $ (Infrared region)\n",

    "- **Example Calculation:**\n",
    "  - Wavelength of light emitted when an electron moves from n=4 to n=2:\n",
    " \n",
    " sub Eq 5 into Eq 1 and sub in\n",
    "$$\\frac{c}{\\lambda}=\\nu$$\n",

    "## **6. Limitations of the Bohr Model**\n",
    "While the Bohr model was a significant advancement, it had several limitations:\n",
    "- No justification for **stationary orbits** or **quantized angular momentum**.\n",
    "- Failed to accurately predict spectra for atoms other than hydrogen.\n",
    "- Could not explain **fine structure** (small spectral line splitting).\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7.2 Quantum Mechanics and Schrödinger’s Equation**  \n",
    "- The Bohr model was an important step in understanding atomic structure, but **modern quantum mechanics** provides a more complete picture.\n",
    "- Instead of treating electrons as **orbiting particles**, quantum mechanics describes them as **waves** using a function called the **wavefunction** $ \\Psi(x,t) $, which contains all the information about the electron.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Schrödinger Equation**  \n",
    "The fundamental equation of quantum mechanics is the **Schrödinger equation**, which determines how the wavefunction $\\Psi$ behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation**\n",
    "For an electron moving in an atom, we use the **time-independent Schrödinger equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{d^2\\Psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\\Psi = E\\Psi \\tag{8}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\hbar = \\frac{h}{2\\pi} $ is the **reduced Planck's constant**.\n",
    "- $ m $ is the **mass of the electron**.\n",
    "- $ V(x) $ is the **potential energy** (for a hydrogen atom, this is the electrostatic attraction to the nucleus).\n",
    "- $ E $ is the **total energy** of the electron.\n",
    "- $ \\Psi(x) $ is the **wavefunction**, which tells us where the electron is **most likely** to be found.\n",

    "##### **In Three Dimensions (Spherical Form)**\n",
    "Since atoms are three-dimensional, we use **spherical coordinates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**You do not need to know this maths!!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\Psi + V(r) \\Psi = E \\Psi \\tag{9}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ \\nabla^2 $ is the **Laplacian operator**, which accounts for the three-dimensional motion of the electron.\n",
    "- $ r $ is the **distance from the nucleus**.\n",
    "- $ V(r) = -\\frac{e^2}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} $ is the **Coulomb potential energy** from the nucleus.\n",

    "## **8. Conclusion**\n",
    "- The **Bohr model** was a major step toward understanding atomic structure.\n",
